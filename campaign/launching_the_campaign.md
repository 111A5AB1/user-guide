# Launching the Campaign
Now that we have all the pieces setup, we can launch the campaign!

To create a new campaign, navigate to the Campaigns page and click the "New Campaign" button.

Most of the settings should be self-explanatory. The only thing to look out for is the `URL` field. Since the IP address of our Gophish server is `192.168.1.1`, that's what we'll use:

Once all the settings filled, click "Launch Campaign" to start sending the emails!

## Viewing the Results
After launching the campaign, you will be automatically redirected to the campaign results page. This will give you a realtime view as emails are sent, opened, and links are clicked.
