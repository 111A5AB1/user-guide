# Creating the Template

To create the template we will use for our Morning Catch campaign, first navigate to the "Email Templates" page and click the "New Template" button.

We notice that Morning Catch comes with a webmail portal. Letâ€™s craft a simple template that suggests the user needs to go reset their password. Obviously, this is a simple scenario, and by using the "Import Email" feature, you can import existing emails directly into gophish for a greater effect.

By clicking the "HTML" tab, we will see the editor we can use to create our HTML content:

Since our content is pretty simple, we can just click the "Source" button and be taken to the more visual editor, which will be enough for our purposes:
